        WebStudy is a HTML website that helps students, as well as teachers, save time. The professors can check/update the grades, participation in events on Facebook, number of GitHub submits, and the percentage of promovability of each student. According to it's promovability rate, automatical suggestions are made by the app in order to help the student check the courses needed for improving and evolving.

        <h3><span>4.3 </span>Json</h3>
        <p>
        JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format. It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate. It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language, Standard ECMA-262 3rd Edition - December 1999. JSON is a text format that is completely language independent but uses conventions that are familiar to programmers of the C-family of languages, including C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript, Perl, Python, and many others. These properties make JSON an ideal data-interchange language.

          <h3><span>4.5 </span>AJAX</h3>
          <p>
            Ajax, short for "Asynchronous JavaScript And XML", is a set of Web development techniques using many Web technologies on the client side to create asynchronous Web applications. With Ajax, Web applications can send and retrieve data from a server asynchronously(in the background) without interfering with the display and behaviour of the existing page. By decoupling the data interchange layer from the presentation layer, Ajax allows Web pages, and by extension Web applications, to change content dynamically without the need to reload the entire page.

          <h3><span>4.7 </span>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</h3>
          <p>
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

          <p>
            Application programming interfaces(API) have been around since the 1960s. Without APIs, the digital experiences that we expect every day as consumers wouldn’t be possible. They’re doing everything from driving information-rich marketing campaigns and connecting mobile apps to streamlining internal operations. APIs do a lot of heavy lifting, both in mobile and on the web. They’re responsible for nearly everything we do, and with just a few taps or clicks, let you do things like order a pizza, book a hotel, rate a song, or download software. APIs work quietly in the background, making the interactivity we expect and rely upon possible.

          <h3><span>4.13 </span>MVC</h3>
          <p>
            Model–view–controller is commonly used for developing software that divides an application into three interconnected parts. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user. The MVC design pattern decouples these major components allowing for efficient code reuse and parallel development. Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this architecture has become popular for designing web applications and even mobile, desktop and other clients.

          <p>
            JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

        <h3><span>5.1 </span>Sql Injection</h3>
        <p>
            SQL injection is a code injection technique that might destroy your database. SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques. SQL injection is the placement of malicious code in SQL statements, via web page input. We denied the SQLInjection by using PDO to connect to the database and make the queries with the functions PREPARE and EXECUTE.

        <h3><span>5.2 </span>Cross Site Scripting</h3>
        <p>
            Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. A cross-site scripting vulnerability may be used by attackers to bypass access controls such as the same-origin policy. We used HTMLSPECIALCHARS function to encode the action attribute of the form tag.

      <section id="pov">
        <h2><span>6. </span>Progress</h2>
        <p>
            We have implemented the view for the main page, student's page, professor's page, the page where the professor add grades, and the functionality for buttons.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, it followed the structure of the application based on the design pattern MVC. We created the database in which we added the general informations regarding the students and teachers autentification data. Then we have implemented the controllers for autentification.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have then implemented the autentification of the users, preventing against the attacks. Then followed the method of uploading the grades by the professor manually as well as from a csv file. Afer the prefessor introduces data and click the "Administreaza" button, the data are introduced in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            The next issue was the functionalities of the page student. For each student we took the data from the database and we diplayed the grades in the table section. We've implemented login with GitHub and Facebook and we also took the number of commits from GitHub so we can show it on our page for students to see.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we made the algorithm that calculated the final grade of each student until the current week. Thanks to the final grade we calculated the procent of promovability for each student, and if this procent is lower then 50% we query the database for the link which is useful to the student pass, regarding the current week.
        </p>
        <p>
            We implemented then an RESTAPIs that shows us all the students and their notes when we make an GET request. When we make a POST request we inserate into the database the user of the student alongside with it's grade. If we have a DELETE request, we delete the user alongside with it's grades from the database.
